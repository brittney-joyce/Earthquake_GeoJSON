# USGS Earthquake Data Visualization

### For this assignment, we pulled Geo JSON data from USGS website to analyze any earthquake trends. I have chosen to visualize a geo json data set with 4.5+ magnitude of earthquakes in the last week. 

### Our data showed us that there is quite a bit of seismic activity within a span of a week. A vast majority of these earthquakes occur near the coast line.
